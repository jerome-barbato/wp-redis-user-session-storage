## Overview

Store WordPress user session tokens in Redis rather than the usermeta table. Requires PECL Redis library.

Requires WordPress 4.0, which should be released soon but isnâ€™t currently suitable for production sites. In the meantime, **everything** is subject to change.

## Installation
1. Install and configure Redis. There is a good tutorial [here](http://www.saltwebsites.com/2012/install-redis-245-service-centos-6).
2. Install the [Redis PECL module](http://pecl.php.net/package/redis).
3. Activate the plugin network-wide or by placing it in `mu-plugins`.
4. By default, the script will connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379. See the *Connecting to Redis* section for further options.

### Connecting to Redis ###

By default, the plugin uses `127.0.0.1` and `6379` as the default host and port when creating a new client instance; the default database of `0` is also used. Three constants are provided to override these default values.

Specify `WP_REDIS_USER_SESSION_HOST`, `WP_REDIS_USER_SESSION_PORT`, and `WP_REDIS_USER_SESSION_DB` to set the necessary, non-default connection values for your Redis instance.
